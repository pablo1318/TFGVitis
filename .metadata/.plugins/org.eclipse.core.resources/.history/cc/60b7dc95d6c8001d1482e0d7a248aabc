Description:

    This example uses the load/compute/store coding style which is generally
    the most efficient for implementing kernels using HLS. The load and store
    functions are responsible for moving data in and out of the kernel as
    efficiently as possible. The core functionality is decomposed across one
    of more compute functions. Whenever possible, the compute function should
    pass data through HLS streams and should contain a single set of nested loops.

    HLS stream objects are used to pass data between producer and consumer
    functions. Stream read and write operations have a blocking behavior which
    allows consumers and producers to synchronize with each other automatically.

    The dataflow pragma instructs the compiler to enable task-level pipelining.
    This is required for to load/compute/store functions to execute in a parallel
    and pipelined manner. Here the kernel loads, computes and stores NUM_WORDS integer values per
    clock cycle and is implemented as below:
